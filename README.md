# 727Hunt
A plugin to spice up your manhunts

###### notice
first time using java in a while, and this is def my first time making plugins for paper

## What does it do
It makes it so the hunted person/people obtain random positive effects upon killing the hunted.

## How to use it
1. Modify `main/java/lgbt/nora/PlayerKilledListener.java` to have the hunted person's username in the `hunted` list. Keep an empty value at the end.<br/>

2. Compile the plugin

###### Misc
- Made by request for [Aga](https://github.com/SnoKami)
- This plugin *should* work fine with `/reload`s, but no guarantees
- I have only tested it on Paper@1.19.1<br/>
> It should work on 1.18.2, but no guarantees
